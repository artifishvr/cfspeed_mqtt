# Cloudflare Speed Tests sent over MQTT

This is a simple Rust program that performs a Cloudflare speed test every 30 seconds and sends the results over MQTT. Useful for home assistant.

Inspired by [simonjenny/fastcom-mqtt](https://github.com/simonjenny/fastcom-mqtt), remade in Rust and using Cloudflare's Speedtest instead of Fast.com.
